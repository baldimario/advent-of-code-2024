# Advent Of Code 2024

## Description

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenge.
[https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

The solutions are written in Python and are run in a Docker container.
You can run the solutions using the Makefile provided.

This solution is based on tools that I want to become more familiar with.
I will force myself to write unit and functional tests for each solution before I run it.

## How to run

To run the solutions, you can use the following command:

```bash
make build
make run
```

then you can select the day you want to run and the exercise you want to run.

## Dependencies

- Docker
- Make
